# **App Name**: BaseBoard

## Core Features:

- Leaderboard Display: Display a leaderboard of builders, showing their usernames, wallet addresses, and scores, fetched from the contract.
- Wallet Connection: Allow users to connect their wallets using RainbowKit for authentication.
- Error Display: Display any error messages (e.g., network errors) prominently to the user.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant blue (#3498db), symbolizing trust and technology, which are fitting for a blockchain application. The color is versatile and contrasts well with a light background.
- Background color: A very light blue (#f0f8ff) desaturated and light, providing a clean backdrop that does not distract from the leaderboard content.
- Accent color: A contrasting orange (#e67e22), for interactive elements and highlights. This should be used sparingly, drawing attention without overwhelming.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif), chosen for its modern, neutral appearance and readability, suitable for both headings and body text.
- Use a clean, card-based layout for the leaderboard entries. Each entry should clearly display the builder's username, wallet address (abbreviated), and score.
- Use simple, recognizable icons to represent blockchain or building-related concepts, where appropriate.  Keep the style consistent throughout the app.
- Subtle animations can be used on wallet connection or leaderboard updates to provide feedback to the user, but should be kept minimal to avoid distraction.
